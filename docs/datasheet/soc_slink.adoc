|=======================

The SLINK component provides up to 8 independent RX (receiving) and TX (sending) links for moving
stream data. The interface provides higher bandwidth and less latency than the external memory bus
interface, which makes it ideally suited to couple custom stream processing units (like CORDICs, FFTs or
cryptographic accelerators).

Each individual link provides an internal FIFO for data buffering. The FIFO depth is globally defined
for all TX links via the _SLINK_TX_FIFO_ generic and for all RX links via the _SLINK_RX_FIFO_ generic.
The FIFO depth has to be at least 1, which will implement a simple input/output register. The maximum
value is limited to 32768 entries. Note that the FIFO depth has to be a power of two (for optimal
logic mapping).

The actual number of implemented RX/TX links is configured by the _SLINK_NUM_RX_ and _SLINK_NUM_TX_
generics. The SLINK module will be synthesized only if at least one of these generics is greater than
zero. All unimplemented links are internally terminated and their according output signals are set to zero.

[NOTE]
The NEORV32 stream link interfaces are compatible to the _AXI Stream_ specs.


**Theory of Operation**

The SLINK provides eight data registers (`DATA[i]`) to access the links (read accesses will access the RX links,
write accesses will access the TX links), one control register (`CTRL`) and one status register (`STATUS`).

The SLINK is globally activated by setting the control register's enable bit _SLINK_CTRL_EN_. Clearing this
bit will reset all internal logic and will also clear all data FIFOs. The actual data links are accessed by
reading or writing the according link data registers `DATA[0]` to `DATA[7]`. For example, writing the `DATA[0]`
will put the according data into the FIFO of TX link 0. Accordingly, reading from `DATA[0]` will return one data
word from the FIFO of RX link 0.

The current link status of each RX and TX channel is accessible via the `STATUS` register. Each link provides a
read-only FIFO status flag in this register: the _SLINK_CTRL_RX_AVAIL_ flags indicate that there is _at least_
one data word available in the according RX link's FIFO. The _SLINK_CTRL_TX_FREE_ flags indicate
there is _at least_ one free entry in the according TX link's FIFO.

[NOTE]
Writing to a TX link's FIFO that is _full_ will have no effect. Reading data from a RX link's FIFO that is
_empty_ will have no effect and will return the last valid data word.

The "end of packet" signal `lst` is controlled by the status register's _SLINK_STATUS_RX_LAST_ and
_SLINK_STATUS_TX_LAST_ bits. Note that the RX/TX `lst` signal is also buffered by the internal FIFOs.
Setting a bit in _SLINK_STATUS_TX_LAST_ before writing data to `DATA` will set the `lst` signal when the
written data word is actually send from the FIFO. Vice versa, a bit in _SLINK_STATUS_RX_LAST_ will be set
if the according data word read from `DATA` was marked as "end of packet". 


**Data Transmission**

To send (TX) data the program should ensure there is at least one left in the according link's FIFO by checking
_SLINK_CTRL_TX_FREE_. To mark the current data word to-be-send as "end of packet" the according _SLINK_STATUS_TX_LAST_
bit has to be set _before_ writing `DATA`.

Receive (RX) is available when the according link's _SLINK_CTRL_RX_AVAIL_ bit is set. To check if the received data
is marked as "end of packet" the according _SLINK_STATUS_RX_LAST_ has to be checked _before_ reading `DATA`.


**Interface & Protocol**

The SLINK interface consists of four signals `dat`, `val`, `rdy` and `lst` for each RX and TX link.
Each signal is an "array" with eight entires (one for each link). Note that an entry in `slink_*x_dat` is 32-bit
wide while entries in `slink_*x_val` and `slink_*x_rdy` are are just 1-bit wide.

* `dat` contains the actual data word
* `val` marks the current transmission cycle as valid
* `rdy` indicates that the receiving part is ready to receive
* `lst` marks the current data word as "end of packet"

**SLINK Interrupts**

The stream interface provides two independent CPU interrupts - one for RX conditions (data received) and one
for TX conditions (ready to send). The RX interrupt is controlled per-link by the _SLINK_CTRL_RX_IRQ_EN_
control register bits while the TX interrupt is controlled per-link by the _SLINK_CTRL_TX_IRQ_EN_ control
register bits. If any enabled link fulfills the RX/TX interrupt condition a RX/TX interrupt request is
sent to the CPU. Note that all RX and TX interrupt conditions are logically OR-ed.

* RX interrupt: if the FIFO of link _i_ changes from status "empty" to "not empty" (data available) and the
according _SLINK_CTRL_RX_IRQ_EN_ bit is set the SLINK RX interrupt is triggered
* TX interrupt: if the FIFO of link _i_ changes from status "full" to "not full" (ready to send) and the
according _SLINK_CTRL_TX_IRQ_EN_ bit is set the SLINK TX interrupt is triggered

Once the SLINK's RX or TX CPU interrupt has become pending, it has to be explicitly cleared again by writing
zero to the according <<_mip>> CSR bit(s).
